  annote =      {Most effective particular object and image retrieval approaches are
	based on the bag-of-words (BoW) model. All state-of-the-art retrieval
	results have been achieved by methods that include a query expansion
	that brings a significant boost in performance. We introduce three
	modifications to automatic query expansion: (i) a method capable
	of preventing query expansion failure caused by the presence of confusers,
	(ii) an improved spatial verification and re-ranking step that incrementally
	builds a statistical model of the query object and (iii) we learn
	relevant spatial context to boost retrieval performance. The three
	improvements of query expansion were evaluated on established Paris
	and Oxford datasets according to a standard protocol, and state-of-the-art
	results were achieved.},
