  annote = {We present a novel similarity measure for bag-of-words type large
	scale image retrieval. The similarity function is learned in an unsupervised
	manner, requires no extra space over the standard bag-of-words method
	and is more discriminative than both L2-based soft assignment and
	Hamming embedding. Experimentally we show that the novel similarity
	function achieves mean average precision that is superior to any
	result published in the literature on the standard Oxford 105k dataset/protocol.
	At the same time, retrieval with the proposed similarity function
	is faster than the reference method.},
