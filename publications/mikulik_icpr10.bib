  annote = {We propose a novel method for the refinement of Maximally Stable
	Extremal Region (MSER) boundaries to sub-pixel precision by taking
	into account the intensity function in the 2x2 neighborhood of the
	contour points. The proposed method improves the repeatability and
	precision of Local Affine Frames (LAFs) constructed on extremal regions.
	Additionally, we propose a novel method for detection of local curvature
	extrema on the refined contour. Experimental evaluation on publicly
	available datasets shows that matching with the modified LAFs leads
	to a higher number of correspondences and a higher inlier ratio in
	more than 80% of the test image pairs. Since the processing time
	of the contour refinement is negligible, there is no reason not to
	include the algorithms as a standard part of the MSER detector and
	LAF constructions.},
